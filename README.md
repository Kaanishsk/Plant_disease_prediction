# Plant_disease_prediction

This Plant Disease Prediction project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify plant diseases based on leaf images, aiming to provide a reliable tool for early disease detection and management in agriculture. By training on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images, the model learns to recognize and differentiate between healthy plants and various common diseases with high accuracy. This can assist farmers, gardeners, and agriculture enthusiasts in identifying diseases early, leading to timely and informed interventions. The model can be further developed into a mobile or web application, making disease detection accessible and convenient.
